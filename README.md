# Kubernetes 

## What is Kubernetes?
-->Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
## Why we use Kubernetes ?
**Container Orchestration:**
Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, allowing for efficient container orchestration.

**Automatic Load Balancing:**
Kubernetes can automatically distribute network traffic across multiple containers to ensure optimal load balancing and performance.

**Self-Healing:**
If a container or node fails, Kubernetes can automatically detect the failure and take corrective actions, such as restarting containers on healthy nodes, to maintain application availability.
